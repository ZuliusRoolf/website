# Portfolio Template (Instructions NOT Validated)

This template is designed to showcase your projects in the form of a portfolio. It features two main sections: a biography container and a portfolio container. The biography container displays your photo, name, profession, social links, and a short bio. The portfolio container provides a list of projects with dates. Clicking on a project reveals more details, such as an image or video, contributors, a description, and a link to more details.
