# Journal
This is a quick journal on how I develop this website. It will be used for documentation for both tools used and thought process.

## 13 July
I have restarted my repository to the minimum through the "learning" branch. This may brake the [pages](.github\workflows\pages.yml) workflow to deploy.
I had setup next.js before this entry. That setup is now removed. I have never build a website before and have always struggled using tools such as node and Jekyll to build websites. The goal of this proejct is to understand the basics of front-end development. I don't need tools for that, except HTML, CSS and JS. In the future I should take time to learn React.

I have installed Live Server to my VS Code. I don't know if I need it. It will host my website locally for me to edit.

I use Mr. Ranedeer to teach me about the basics of web development. It is a GPT model, which also means I can ask questions. https://mr-ranedeer.com/
